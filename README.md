# 🧰 Proxmox Toolbox

A small collection of fun and useful scripts for managing and automating tasks on [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve).  
These are scripts I’ve built for my own setups, but feel free to use, adapt, or contribute!

## 🚀 What's Inside?

Scripts will vary over time, but can include things like:

- Automated configuration
- Shutdown handling with UPS
- Cleanup utilities
- Monitoring tweaks
- And other time-saving tools

## 📂 Usage

Most scripts are standalone Bash scripts.  
To use a script:

\`\`\`bash
chmod +x scriptname.sh
./scriptname.sh
\`\`\`

Make sure to read the script before running it — some might require root privileges or be adapted to your setup.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These scripts are provided as-is, with no warranty.  
Test before deploying on production systems. Use at your own risk.

## 📬 Feedback & Contributions

PRs and suggestions are always welcome!

Happy hacking 👨‍💻
